                            <p>I still remember that day back in 2014 when I decided to start
                                Android development, and that was one of the best decisions I took
                                in my life. It has been around two and a half years now and I had
                                the chance to learn and un-learn a lot of things in Android.
                                Initially when I started, I didn’t have a mentor or someone who
                                could guide me to do things the right way. I did a LOT of mistakes
                                and also wasted a lot of time doing and later rectifying them.
                                Later, after one and a half years, I got the chance to work with
                                some really talented and experienced Android developers, who guided
                                me and helped me shape things in a much better way. Both of these
                                phases helped me learn a hell lot of things in the HARD way. I
                                learned what TO DO and most importantly what NOT TO DO.
                                It has been quite some time that I have been trying to help other
                                developers in ways possible to me, directly and indirectly. Here are
                                my StackOverflow and Github profiles.
                                In this article, I will be sharing some of the gems that I have
                                collected in these years. It might help someone to get started
                                faster and not repeat the mistakes that I once did.
                                Disclaimer: I will mainly be focussing on Android and some concepts
                                of programming and product development in this article, so if you
                                are not familiar with any of these, you might not want to read any
                                further. Others, just dive in. :-)</p>

                                    <p>Initially, I had a bad idea of not using open-source
                                        libraries. Whatever I needed, I just wanted to make it
                                        myself. It’s was seriously a terrible idea.
                                        If you have a problem while developing your app, and if that
                                        problem has been solved by someone else before and in a good
                                        way, why not use that? You can save yourself a lot of time.
                                        Focus more on the core business logic of your app. If you
                                        want to make network calls in your app, you don’t need to
                                        make a Retrofit yourself.

                                    <h3>2. Choose Libraries Wisely</h3>
                                    <p>There are lots and lots of open-source libraries available in
                                        Github for you to use for FREE. But don’t get too excited
                                        and start using libraries blindly.
                                        Check the number of stars that particular library has, the
                                        more the better. Check if the author of that library have
                                        also created some other popular libraries as well. Check the
                                        issues (both open and closed), which can give you a better
                                        idea of how robust and stable the library is in production.
                                        If you can afford the time, you should dive into the code of
                                        that library and check yourself if its really worth it.
                                        You just want to ensure that the code you are going to use
                                        is reliable, bug-free and high-quality.
                                        Pro Tip: Try out any library hosted directly from the
                                        command line using Dryrun.</p>

                                    <h3>3. Sit, Take a Cup of Coffee and Read More Code</h3>
                                    <p>We spent most of our time reading others code than writing
                                        ourselves. If you are not doing that, START today.
                                        Whatever code you are able to write today is only because
                                        you have read and learned something, somewhere, someday.
                                        It’s just a reflection of what you already know. You can
                                        only grow and improve yourself by reading and learning from
                                        other’s work.
                                        The great thing about Android is that it is a completely
                                        open-source platform. Dive into the code and check how they
                                        have implemented the framework. There are thousands of
                                        open-source libraries in Github. Just pick a library and see
                                        how the developer have implemented it.

                                    <h3>4. For God’s Sake, Maintain Proper Coding Standards</h3>
                                    <p>If you compare coding with writing, then coding standards is
                                        like your handwriting.
                                        As you would be reading more of others code, other people
                                        will also be reading a lot of your code and you don’t want
                                        to scare the shit out of them, do you? And if you are
                                        working in an organization and collaborating with other
                                        developers heavily, do take special care about it.
                                        Write short, clean and readable code that YOU and people
                                        reading your code would enjoy thoroughly. Your code should
                                        read like a story.
                                        Code is Poetry.
                                        Don’t complain if you write a piece of code and your
                                        colleagues don’t talk to you for a few days.
                                        Bonus: To start with, you must thoroughly go through this
                                        and this.</p>
                                    <h3>5. You Need ProGuard, Yes, You Need It!</h3>
                                    <p>Never ever, ever make the mistake of releasing your app on
                                        the Play Store without using ProGuard. ProGuard not only
                                        minifies your code, but it obfuscates your code making it
                                        harder for reverse-engineers to understand, replicate and
                                        manipulate it.
                                        Its absolutely free and comes bundled with the Android SDK,
                                        and there is absolutely no reason for you not to use it.
                                        I have seen several developers releasing their app on the
                                        market without ProGuard. It should not take more than a few
                                        hours for a not-so-skilled hacker to manipulate an the app
                                        released without Proguard.
                                        Pro Tip: But if you want top-notch security, then ProGuard
                                        is like a cardboard while you need a safe, and here it is,
                                        DexGuard.</p>
                                    <h3>6. Use a Proper Architecture</h3>
                                    <p>You will forever thank yourself for choosing a proper
                                        architecture in the first place.
                                        You can use MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture which
                                        can decouple your code into different easy-to-manage layers
                                        thereby improving code flexibility and greatly reducing
                                        maintenance time.
                                        There is a great demo project for you to start. And if you
                                        are having a hard time grasping it, here is a detailed guide
                                        for the beginners.
                                        Bonus: Do give a check at this, this and most importantly
                                        this. All of these can greatly help you in implementing MVP
                                        in your project.</p>

                                    <h3>7. User Interface Is like a Joke, If You Have to Explain It,
                                        It’s Bad</h3>
                                    <p>If you work for any organization playing the role of “just”
                                        an Android developer, you probably won’t need to be too
                                        concerned about this, as there are UI/UX designers to take
                                        care of this.
                                        But if you are an individual developer, you need to get this
                                        straight into your head. I have seen developers creating
                                        really good apps with great functionality, but the UI looks
                                        horrible and the UX makes it a pain to use.
                                        Design a clean, simple and beautiful interface that is easy
                                        on the eyes. You should not just think like a developer,
                                        rather you should concentrate on igniting the hidden
                                        designer inside you.
                                        Try to create a lasting impression on your users by
                                        designing a beautiful UI, so that they keep coming back to
                                        your app more often than others and tend to convert more
                                        (buy your premium version, maybe).
                                        You should get a kick by removing elements from your design,
                                        rather than adding. Keep it clean and minimal.
                                        Bonus: You can always get design inspiration from popular
                                        designers of Dribble or MaterialUp. And there is this book
                                        you probably would love to read if you are interested in
                                        design.</p>
                                    <h3>8. Analytics Is Your Best Friend</h3>
                                    <p>If you want to create a truly amazing app, you need to
                                        heavily rely on analytics tools to analyze the performance
                                        and usage of different parts of your app.
                                        By analytics, I refer to both crash reporting and app usage
                                        tracking and you need both of them.
                                        Whatever you do, you can never make something perfect. When
                                        real users will start using your app on a variety of Android
                                        devices and on various Android versions available, you will
                                        even see some of your best written code to fall flat on the
                                        ground.
                                        Crash reporting tools can help you to track and fix them,
                                        one crash at a time.
                                        You also need to start thinking like a marketer and analyze
                                        the usage of various portions of your app. This is what will
                                        help you bridge the gap between what you made and what your
                                        users’ actually want.
                                        Pro Tip: Use Firebase Crash Reporting and Analytics tools
                                        and you can thank me later.</p>
                                    <h3>9. Be a Marketing Ninja</h3>
                                    <p>If you are an individual developer, you have to think beyond
                                        being “just a developer” and have to understand marketing as
                                        well.
                                        I have seen good products fail due to lack of proper
                                        marketing, and the not-so-good ones become massively
                                        successful just because of great marketing.
                                        If you are serious about your work and want it to reach a
                                        large audience, you need to invest your time and money in
                                        properly marketing your app. But before starting your
                                        marketing campaigns, ensure that your app is absolutely
                                        stable with all features ready. You want maximum conversions
                                        from every dime you spend, right?
                                        Spend time researching who your competitors are and how you
                                        can beat them. Identify the ones you can compete immediately
                                        and the ones you have to keep aside for a future fight.

                                        to use.</p>
                                    <h3>10. It’s Time to Optimize Your App</h3>
                                    <p>This is something that most of us generally don’t do, but you
                                        should and you need to.
                                        There is a big difference between writing code and writing
                                        “optimized” code. Write code that runs quickly, takes less
                                        memory and consumes less device storage.
                                        An unoptimized app works well under normal circumstances,
                                        but when put to different stressful situations, it can show
                                        you its true colors.
                                        Check the amount of memory used by your app and look for
                                        memory leaks. Remember, a tiny leak can sink a big ship.
                                        Spend time on understanding how the Garbage Collector works
                                        in Java, create heap dumps and analyze your live objects.
                                        Pro Tip: Use Leak Canary to detect your memory leaks. It can
                                        save you a lot of time by automating this task for you.</p>

                                    <p>It’s very very likely that you are using Android Studio to
                                        develop Android apps and using Gradle as your build system.
                                        Gradle is great but its slow and it becomes slower than a
                                        snail when your project size starts to grow in size.
                                        I remember the countless hours I have wasted just sitting
                                        and waiting for the Gradle builds to finish. On heavy work
                                        days, I easily wasted around an hour on just Gradle builds
                                        and that’s like 5 hours a week draining down the gutter.
                                        But, there are ways to speed it up too.
                                        You can follow this and this post to significantly improve
                                        your build speeds. My build time dropped from 4 minutes to
                                        less than 30 seconds after proper optimization.</p>
                                    <h3>12. Test, Test and When You Are Done, Test Again!</h3>
                                    <p>There is nothing more important than testing. This is
                                        something that should be at the top of your list.
                                        Test your app as thoroughly as possible. Spend time for
                                        writing automated test cases. Create various stressful
                                        situations for your app and see if it can survive.
                                        I had once made the mistake of releasing my app out of hurry
                                        and didn’t spend proper time testing it. I was waiting for
                                        my users to face bugs, report it and then I would go and fix
                                        them.
                                        Never, ever, ever do that. You might save a day, or two, or
                                        a week by cutting down time from testing, but will probably
                                        have to spend more than twice later.
                                        Don’t do anything out of hurry, take your time and think
                                        long term. Be a visionary. Sow now, reap later.</p>
                                    <h3>13. Android Fragmentation is a Devil in Disguise</h3>

                                    <p>Fragmentation is one of the biggest problems in Android and
                                        Google seems reluctant to fix it, but you have to live with
                                        it.
                                        There are a huge variety of Android devices with different
                                        screen sizes and hardware specifications from a plethora of
                                        different device manufactures who customize the OS to their
                                        heart’s content.
                                        Added to that are the various Android versions where Google
                                        adds/removes API functionality out of nowhere to increase
                                        your workload ever further (an example here).
                                        For example, not a single Android developer has finished an
                                        app without using SharedPreferences API. It’s so common, yet
                                        it was broken in Samsung Galaxy S with Android 2.2 (bug
                                        report here).
                                        Spend more time creating different layouts for different
                                        screen sizes. Test on different devices, having different
                                        versions, different specifications and from different OEMs.
                                        Never assume something would work, just because it seems
                                        so.</p>
                                    <h3>14. Start using Git, Today!</h3>
                                    <p>If you are still not using Git, go ahead and start using it
                                        right away.
                                        When I started Android development, I was unfortunate enough
                                        not to know what the fudge Git was. I used to copy my entire
                                        project everyday and keep one backup in my hard drive and
                                        another in the cloud. Seems foolish? Yes, it absolutely was.
                                        Git can dramatically improve your workflow. If someone asks
                                        me to name a tool that I use everyday and can’t stop using?
                                        It’s Git and Git every time.
                                        And probably after using it for a few days you would fall in
                                        love with it and want to know how Git works internally, so
                                        here it is ready for you.
                                        And after some time, you would be starting a big project
                                        yourself and get confused on how you should maintain a
                                        proper branching model, so here you go.
                                        Bonus: If you are just starting out and can’t afford to pay
                                        the monthly subscription fee for maintaining private
                                        repositories in GitHub, you can try BitBucket which lets you
                                        do just that for free.</p>
                                    <h3>15. Make it Difficult for the Hackers</h3>
                                    <p>The open-source nature of Android is what makes it vulnerable
                                        to attacks. Every Android app can be decompiled,
                                        reverse-engineered, ripped open, analyzed and manipulated
                                        with ease.
                                        You don’t want that to happen to your app, right?
                                        You should know how to securely store API keys locally in
                                        your app. If you are dealing with sensitive data of the
                                        users, then you must know how to encrypt them, what
                                        algorithm to choose (secure yet fast).
                                        You should also store the encryption keys securely either in
                                        the server or locally (if needed). You should prevent your
                                        app data from being backed up using the ADB (Android Debug
                                        Bridge). If you are storing sensitive data in the database,
                                        consider obfuscating it.
                                        If your app has a premium version which gets cracked and
                                        gets released for free. You would incur a serious loss in
                                        business, right?
                                        There are several things you can do to prevent your app from
                                        getting tampered. There is nothing like 100% security. Any
                                        skilled and determined hacker with the right resources,
                                        tools and patience can crack your app.
                                        All you want to do is make it difficult, rather very
                                        difficult for the hacker to crack it.
                                        Bonus: Reading this and this should be a good start towards
                                        securing your app.</p>
                                    <h3>16. Develop On a Low-End Device</h3>
                                    <p>Everyone loves to use a high-end Android smartphone, so do I.
                                        But remember to keep it for your personal use only and never
                                        use it for development purposes.
                                        A high-end device will hide a lot of flaws while developing
                                        your app. Suppose you are doing something in the UI thread
                                        which makes its way for a laggy UI, but on a powerful
                                        device, you may never ever notice that.
                                        An old, low-end device, dumped with lots of apps makes it
                                        ideal for a development device.</p>

                                    <h3>17. Invest in Learning Design Patterns</h3>
                                    <p>This is an investment that will pay you forever.
                                        While developing big and complex apps, you will face some
                                        common problems which have probably been solved before by
                                        someone more competent than you, that’s when design patterns
                                        comes into play.
                                        Start spending some time right from today to learn the Java
                                        Design Patterns. Here is a Github project that demonstrates
                                        all the design patterns known to mankind.
                                        To start off, learn the most important ones like Singleton,
                                        Adapter, Factory Method, Iterator, Dependency Injection,
                                        Event Driven Architecture, Builder, Callback, Strategy,
                                        Facade and Producer Consumer.
                                        Seems like a lot? It actually isn’t. You will start loving
                                        them once you dive in.
                                        Pro Tip: Read books like GoF’s Design Patterns, Refactoring
                                        by Martin Fowler and Effective Java by Joshua Bloch.</p>
                                    <h3>18. It’s Time to Give Back</h3>
                                    <p>We all have got a lot of help from people around us and from
                                        the Internet. Lets admit it.

                                        Whenever you have a problem, the first thing you would do is
                                        Google that and find the first link from StackOverflow.
                                        Sometimes you are in a hurry and you end up copying and
                                        pasting the solution from the answer having the highest
                                        votes.
                                        Ever thought the number of libraries you are using from
                                        Github for free and how they have greatly reduced your
                                        development time and efforts. Its because someone somewhere
                                        has taken the time to build it and contribute to make the
                                        community better.
                                        Remember the day, when you were stuck in understanding a
                                        difficult concept or something which is entirely new to you,
                                        and you end up finding an awesome blog post which made it
                                        super easy for you. Its because somebody skipped a movie
                                        date and wrote that article.
                                        Its your time to give back as well. The more you give, the
                                        more you get back in return.
                                        We all are busy in our own work and we find it too difficult
                                        to manage time and do something for others. But try to find
                                        some time every week to contribute and make this Android
                                        community richer.
                                        I have tried to share some of the lessons that I have
                                        learned in this short journey with Android development. I
                                        will continue my journey, learn more and share even more. I
                                        hope it helps someone and makes their life a bit easier.</p>
